## Premise
Using Twine 2 as a storytelling tool to increase privacy awareness among Gen Z.

## Synopsis
As more and more of current society takes place on online social networks, the question raises what the consequences are to our privacy. While this issue has been the subject of discussions recently, there are still real-world effects to our digital presence. During the preliminary research, several privacy-related risks arose, revolving around digital profiles and the inability to opt out of their creation. One target group that is particularly prone to this development is the digitally native generation that is socially and culturally expected to participate in the digital environment. Common solutions to protecting users’ privacy focused on them already having an increased amount of knowledge about digital privacy. This project set out to see a storytelling tool that increases awareness among users.

## Substantiation

Privacy risks on online social networks (OSN) are a subject that has been brought to the attention of an increasingly larger group of users. These OSNs are fully integrated into the daily routines of modern-day society. One age group that is particularly prone to sharing personal information is teenagers. They constitute one of the main user groups of OSN and spend a large part of their lives online (Vanderhoven et al., 2016). With teenagers being one of the largest audiences and them also spending a significant amount of time online, it places them in an interesting position; It is challenging for them to opt-out of services to regain their privacy. Teenagers consider their digital lives as important as their real-life lives, it is seen as an extension of their physical being (Pastore, 2022). Gen Z often spends more than eight hours a day online and is thus engaged in digital culture (Pastore, 2022).

Research shows that the use of social media is a threat to the mental well-being of adolescents, partially fueled by privacy concerns among the group (O’Reilly et al., 2018).  Teenagers are one of the vulnerable groups to suffer privacy risks because of their limited capacity for self-regulation and susceptibility to peer pressure (Alemany et al., 2019).

Research conducted by Alemany et al. (2019) shows that an effective way to create awareness among teenagers is by using soft-paternalism techniques. Their proposed techniques rely on confronting users with their data in tangible scenarios and showing potential risks in real-time. The shock effect led to an increased sense of privacy awareness among the teen participants.

## Project 
The data is collected by using TikTok’s onboarding and basic usage as an example. The users follow the steps and interaction TikTok provides, and data will be collected along the experience.

## Conclusion

By using Twine as an interactive storytelling tool to replicate a part of the customer journey of TikTok, a small insight was given in the data gathering of this social media and others. Based on the interviews conducted, the prototype and concept are perceived as promising among the target audience. Users state to be more aware of their data privacy directly after interacting with the prototype. There is however a lot of room for improvement. A more defined visual style could help with creating a more coherent and immersive experience, as well as guiding the users more with their privacy risks and rights. Users mention that the implication of data profiles and labeling aren’t clear or are too abstract. The functionalities and predictions currently present in the prototype are mostly based on assumptions and were limited in the coding framework Twine provides. For future applications it would be desirable to gain more insights in the categorizing/labeling of online social media profiles and get access to external APIs for more robust datapoints. It would also be beneficial to investigate the possibilities with combining Twine and JavaScript to retrieve more meta data using web APIs. These points of interests will be taken along for the next iteration.
